# Proactive-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Fraudulent transactions are one of the biggest threats to financial institutions. With over 6.3M records and 10 features, I built and evaluated a fraud detection model to identify high-risk transactions and provide actionable recommendations for prevention.


**task is to execute the process for proactive detection of fraud while answering following questions.**

1. Data cleaning including missing values, outliers and multi-collinearity.
2. Describe your fraud detection model in elaboration.
3. How did you select variables to be included in the model?
4. Demonstrate the performance of the model by using best set of tools.
5. What are the key factors that predict fraudulent customer?
6. Do these factors make sense? If yes, How? If not, How not?
7. What kind of prevention should be adopted while company update its infrastructure?
8. Assuming these actions have been implemented, how would you determine if they work?
